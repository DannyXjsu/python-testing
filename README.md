# physics
testing physics, 2d space, control the ball and it flies, it has gravity, portals (:o) and friction (air friction included!)
i'm honestly really proud with what i've achieved, i didn't have to follow tutorials or anything, just thought of a concept and made it a thing

REQUIRES PYGAME (sorry)
