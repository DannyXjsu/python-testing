# python-testing
python scripts i create to learn, nothing special

branches are different scripts

## game-testing | specific
this script requires enquiries (pip install enquiries)

i'm testing how to make text-based games with python, so far i've done significant progress regarding the 'engine', still has a lot of room for improvements, specially with reading save files

the script is well-commented, explains a lot of what i've coded and the code perspective (aka knowing wtf is going on)

warning: i've tried many solutions, but this is impossible to run on windows, enquiries simply does not work on windows, this is linux exclusive
